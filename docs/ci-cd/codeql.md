# CodeQL Security Analysis

This document describes the automated security scanning implemented using GitHub's CodeQL analysis tool.

## Overview

The CodeQL workflow (`codeql.yml`) performs advanced security analysis on our codebase to identify potential vulnerabilities and coding errors.

## Workflow Details

**File Location**: `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`

### Triggers
- Runs on push to main branch
- Runs on pull requests targeting main branch
- Scheduled weekly runs (Thursday at 00:38 UTC)

### What It Does

1. **Security Scanning**
   - Analyzes Java/Kotlin code for security vulnerabilities
   - Performs semantic code analysis
   - Identifies potential security risks and bugs

2. **Types of Checks**
   - SQL injection vulnerabilities
   - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
   - Data flow problems
   - Resource leaks
   - Buffer overflows
   - Common coding errors

### Configuration

```yaml
language: java-kotlin
build-mode: none
permissions:
  security-events: write
  packages: read
  actions: read
  contents: read
```

### Viewing Results

1. **GitHub Security Tab**
   - Navigate to repository's Security tab
   - Select "Code scanning" in sidebar
   - View all CodeQL alerts and findings

2. **Alert Severity Levels**
   - Critical: Immediate attention required
   - High: Should be addressed soon
   - Medium: Should be reviewed
   - Low: Minor issues

## Handling Alerts

1. **For New Alerts**
   - Review the code in question
   - Assess if it's a true positive
   - Create fix in a new branch
   - Submit PR with fix

2. **False Positives**
   - Document why the alert is a false positive
   - Mark as false positive in GitHub interface
   - Consider adding comments in code to explain why it's safe

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**
   - Check Security tab weekly
   - Review new alerts promptly
   - Track fix progress

2. **Documentation**
   - Document any bypassed checks
   - Keep record of false positives
   - Update security policies as needed

## Questions and Support

For questions about:
- CodeQL alerts: Check GitHub's CodeQL documentation
- Specific findings: Create issue with security team
- False positives: Discuss in team code review
